This respository hosts the main lab website of the Grussmayer Lab. 
It was initiated as part of the OLS cohort 6 project for an open super-resolution platform. 
Stay tuned for our FAIR data, hardware and software and the story of how a lab built from the ground up works based on these principles.

## Contributing
