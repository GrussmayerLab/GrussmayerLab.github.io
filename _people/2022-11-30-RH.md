My name is Ran Huo. Since January 2022, I have joined Grussmayer's lab as a PhD student. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Applied Physics, after which I specialized in Optics and Photonics during my Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Program Europhotonics.  

Imaging techniques have always interested me. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, I was inspired by the idea of using optical methods to solve biological problems. During my internship at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, I was able to use fluorescence light-sheet microscopy to visualize inter-cellular signaling pathways. After spending a semester at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Spain, I learned more about super-resolution imaging techniques including STORM and PALM based on single-molecule localization, which motivated me to carry out my thesis project in single-particle tracking at ICFO, Barcelona. For my PhD project at TU Delft, I will be focusing on developing new quantitative imaging methods and exploring self-blinking dyes as used in SOFI.
