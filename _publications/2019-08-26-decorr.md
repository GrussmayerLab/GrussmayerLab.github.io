<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Super-resolution microscopy opened diverse new avenues of research by overcoming the resolution limit imposed by diffraction. Exploitation of the fluorescent emission of individual fluorophores made it possible to reveal structures beyond the diffraction limit. To accurately determine the resolution achieved during imaging is challenging with existing metrics. Here, we propose a method for assessing the resolution of individual super-resolved images based on image partial phase autocorrelation. The algorithm is model-free and does not require any user-defined parameters. We demonstrate its performance on a wide variety of imaging modalities, including diffraction-limited techniques. Finally, we show how our method can be used to optimize image acquisition and post-processing in super-resolution microscopy. </p>
