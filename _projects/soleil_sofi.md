## Overview
Master project super-resolution imaging for optically “complex” biomedical samples by combining Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging on a new light sheet microscope (Single-objective lens inclined light sheet - SOLEIL) with adaptive optics. Joint TU Delft Bioengineering Institute funded project between the Smith Lab @DCSC/3ME and the Grussmayer Lab @BN/AS. 


## Background
Fluorescence super-resolution microscopy has already had tremendous success in revealing cellular organization (neuronal cytoskeleton, mitochondrial architecture, etc.) below the ‘classical’ diffraction limit of optical resolution of about half the wavelength of the emitted light. In practice, many techniques perform well only in optically ”simple“ samples such as isolated and fixed cells and under optimized imaging conditions that can be phototoxic. Problems due to scattering and aberrations arise already at a few microns thickness and most super-resolution imaging is slow. For biomedical applications, there is a growing need to perform experiments in more physiological conditions with living samples of extended depth such as tissues.

## Deliverables - You'll learn
You will learn cell culture and labeling, state-of-the-art super-resolution microscopy methods and adaptive optics. This means you will perform wet lab work, imaging on the SOLEIL microscope with adaptive optics, and data analysis. Depending on your background, the project may include additional data simulation and work on the adaptive optics algorithm or adding microscopy hardware for simultaneous 3D imaging. We are looking for students with a background in systems control, (bio-) physics/engineering or related that are interested to work on a collaborative project between two young TU Delft labs. If you are an TU Delft Systems Control, Nanobiology or Applied Physics master student, this could be a great fit for you

## Schedule
April 2023 onwards
