<h2>How to travel to Delft:</h2>
<p>When flying in from abroad, you will typically arrive at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. From there, the best way to travel is by train. You likely need to change trains once. There are two options: (1) Take the Intercity train to The Hague HS, and from there take either a Sneltrein or a Stoptrein to Delft. Or (2) Take a Stoptrein from Schiphol to Leiden Central Station, and from there catch the Sneltrein to Delft. Journey time from Schiphol airport to Delft train station is about 45 minutes. Once at Delft train station, you can either walk to campus (the train station is at the lower left-hand corner of the campus map), catch a bus, or take a cab. If you choose to go by bus, the busses numbered 40, 69 and 174 will drop you at bus stop Kluyverpark.</p>
